# Data Mining Labs

This repository contains laboratory works for the university **Data Mining** course, focusing on machine learning methods using the Scikit-Learn library in Python. The course covers the basics of shallow learning, including decision trees, support vector machines, ensemble methods, and more.

## Laboratory Topics

1. Getting Started with Python Environment
2. Building and Evaluating Decision Tree and Support Vector Models for Classification and Regression using Scikit-Learn
3. Classification and Regression using Multilayer Perceptron in Scikit-Learn
4. Building and Evaluating Clustering Models using Scikit-Learn
5. Building and Evaluating Ensemble (Boosting) Models for Classification and Regression using Scikit-Learn
